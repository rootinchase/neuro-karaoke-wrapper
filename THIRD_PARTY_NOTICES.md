## GPL-3.0 components (copyleft — the reason this project is GPLv3)

### NeurolingsCE mascot packs
- **What:** The "Neurolings" desktop-pet mascot packs bundled under
  `Android/app/src/main/assets/mascots/` — `Cerber`, `Eviling`, `Neuron`,
  `Tuteling`, `Vedaling`, `Weuron` (sprite frames + `actions.xml` / `behaviors.xml`).
- **Source project:** NeurolingsCE ("Custom Edition"), maintained by **Luda** — a
  Neuro-themed edition in the Neurolings / Shimeji lineage.
- **License:** GNU General Public License v3.0.
- **Project references:**
  - Neurolings project: https://neurofumo.itch.io/neurolings
  - NeurolingsCE source repository: _pending — to be filled in with the canonical
    URL provided by the maintainer (Luda)._
- **Per-pack credits** (each pack also ships its original `info.json` credits,
  bundled unmodified):
  - `Neuron`, `Weuron`, `Eviling` — art by **Paccha** (https://linktr.ee/paccha_);
    configuration by **@promote.** (https://z.ne1.co, https://neuro.us.to) and **@dalekcraft**
  - `Tuteling`, `Vedaling` — art by **Moneka** (https://linktr.ee/monikaphobia);
    configuration by **@promote.** and **@dalekcraft**
  - `Cerber` — art by **AnoWan, 于陌Wan, 六水Wan, 加斯科涅Wan, 士灰Wan** (bilibili);
    configuration by **qingchenyou (@轻尘呦)**
- **Note:** Redistributed here under the same GPL-3.0 terms.

Because the NeurolingsCE mascot packs above are GPL-3.0 and are combined into this
application, the combined work is licensed under GPL-3.0.

## Shimeji-ee — animation engine (permissive, BSD/zlib-style)

- **What:** The Kotlin Neurolings animation engine in
  `Android/app/src/main/java/com/soul/neurokaraoke/ui/tv/neurolings/` is a **port
  of the Shimeji-ee desktop-pet engine** (its XML action/behavior model, the
  `${…}` expression subset, the action/behavior state machine, and the standard
  Shimeji physics constants).
- **Upstream:** Shimeji-ee, maintained by **Kilkakon**; based on the original
  **Shimeji** by **Yuki Yamada** (Group Finity), with later contributions in the
  shimeji4mac lineage.
- **License:** a permissive **BSD / zlib-style** license — **not GPL**. It is
  GPL-compatible, so the port ships as part of this GPL-3.0 app while the original
  notice and attribution below are preserved, as that license requires.
- **Attribution required:** credit Kilkakon and the original authors; do not
  misrepresent the origin of the software. A link to <https://kilkakon.com> is
  appreciated. Project home: <https://kilkakon.com/shimeji/>.
